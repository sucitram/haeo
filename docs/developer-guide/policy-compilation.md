# Policy compilation

This guide explains how user-configured power policies compile into the LP model.
See [Power policies](../modeling/tagged-power.md) for the design rationale.
See [VLAN optimization](vlan-optimization.md) for variable minimization algorithms.

## Overview

Policies are a device-layer concept.
Users configure source-destination pairs with prices and limits.
The compilation pipeline transforms those rules into model-layer constructs.
Those constructs include optimized VLAN assignments, connection tagging, node outbound and inbound tags, and scoped segments.

Every source-capable node receives a VLAN through signature merging.
Policied sources get VLANs based on their rule signatures; unpolicied sources share a single VLAN (the empty-signature group) with no pricing elements.
All VLANs use the same directed reachability analysis, so a connection only carries tags whose sources can actually reach it.
All sink nodes accept every active VLAN so both policied and unpolicied power can reach any destination.

### Step 1: Flow enumeration

Each policy expands into concrete `(source, destination, price_st, price_ts)` tuples.
Wildcards (`*`) expand to capability-matching nodes only: source wildcards expand to
nodes with `is_source=True`, and destination wildcards expand to nodes with `is_sink=True`.

### Step 2: Signature computation

For each source node, collect the set of `(destination, price)` tuples from all matching policies.
This set is the node's **policy signature**.

### Step 3: VLAN assignment

Group sources by identical signature.
Assign one VLAN per group.
This yields the minimum VLAN count for correct policy behavior.

### Step 4: Reachability analysis

For each VLAN, find connections on directed paths from that VLAN's source nodes to *any* sink node — not just the policy's explicit destinations.
Forward reachability follows connection direction (source → target); backward reachability follows reverse direction (target → source).
Only connections whose endpoints appear in both the forward and backward reachable sets receive variables for that VLAN.
This directed approach prevents tags from leaking onto adjacent connections not on a valid source-to-sink path.

Restricting VLAN membership to policy-specific destinations only would force tagged flow to detour through storage (or be curtailed) whenever the source exceeded its policy destination's capacity, because non-destination sinks would refuse the tag.
That manifests as spurious simultaneous battery charge and discharge — power "laundered" through storage purely to relabel its provenance.
Pricing is still placed only on the cut separating source from its policy-specific destinations (Step 8), so non-destination sinks remain policy-free.

Forward reachability is *sink-absorbing*: when traversal arrives at a sink node, the sink is included in the reachable set but expansion does not continue out of it.
Without absorption a storage node (both a source and a sink — a battery) would let any incoming VLAN propagate onto its outbound connections, where the tag would bypass any cost placed on the battery's own VLAN.
The same mechanism powered a phantom charge/discharge arbitrage when a negative-priced charge incentive was paired with a tag-scoped wear cost: the solver could pump tagged flow through the battery at its rate limits, pay only the incentive, and skip the wear because wear lived on a different tag.
Absorbing at sinks eliminates that degree of freedom entirely — the battery's outbound flow now always carries provenance from the battery's own VLAN, so wear (and any other battery-source policy) always applies.
The VLAN's source nodes are exempt from absorption so a storage element's own VLAN can still expand outward from it normally.

Reachability additionally excludes edges whose *target* is one of the VLAN's own source nodes.
A VLAN represents power originating at its sources, so tagged flow must never re-enter its origin.
For a battery (both a source and a sink of its own VLAN) this removes the `Battery:charge` edge from the battery VLAN: the zero-cost self-loop `Battery:discharge → Inverter → Battery:charge → Battery` is no longer expressible in the tagged graph.
Without this exclusion the solver could use solar (or any other incoming VLAN) just to cover the round-trip efficiency loss of a battery self-cycle, funding it with the incoming charge incentive while the wear cost — placed on an outbound cut the loop never crosses — is completely avoided.

### Step 5: Connection tagging

Apply reachability results so each connection gets the set of tags that can traverse it.
Every VLAN — including the unpolicied VLAN — uses the same reachability analysis.

### Step 6: Node outbound tags

Set `outbound_tags` on every source node.
Each source is forced onto its assigned VLAN by `element_power_balance`.

### Step 7: Node inbound tags

Set `inbound_tags` on each sink node.
All sinks accept every active VLAN so both policied and unpolicied power can reach any sink.

Junction nodes (neither source nor sink) do not receive inbound tags.
Power on any VLAN can still flow through junction nodes for routing.

### Step 8: Pricing injection

For each policy, compute a sink-side canonical minimum s-t cut on the per-VLAN subgraph and attach scoped pricing segments to the connections in that cut.
Sources of the cut are the policy's source nodes; sinks are the policy's destination nodes.
The algorithm is Edmonds–Karp max-flow with unit edge capacities; the sink-side canonical cut is recovered from the residual graph by reverse BFS from the super-sink.

Unit capacities and the sink-side choice together guarantee:

- Every source-to-destination path on the VLAN crosses exactly one cut edge, so a unit of tagged flow pays the policy price exactly once.
    No stacking from overlapping sub-cuts, and no flows that bypass pricing.
- Minimum cut cardinality, so pricing is attached to the fewest connections possible.
    This extends cleanly to power-limit policies, which become a single $\sum_{e \in \text{cut}} P^{tag}_{e,t} \le X$ constraint.
- Natural collapse to intuitive placements: target-inbound edges for a specific destination, source-outbound edges for a single-outbound source targeting a wildcard, and a shared bottleneck (e.g. an inverter) when many sources and many destinations converge through a narrower middle.

A source that also appears in the destination set (e.g. a battery is both source and sink after wildcard expansion) has only the self-loop removed from the destination set; other destinations are still cut normally.
Each injected segment's `tag` matches the source VLAN, and `price_source_target` and `price_target_source` map from the policy's directional prices.

## Architecture

### Where compilation runs

Compilation lives in `custom_components/haeo/core/adapters/policy_compilation.py`.
It runs as a post-processing step in `collect_model_elements()`.

### Adapter interaction

The policy adapter produces rule configs, not model elements.
`collect_model_elements()` extracts those rules and passes them to the compilation pipeline.
The pipeline updates other adapters' model element configs by adding connection tags, node `outbound_tags` values, and tag costs.

### Model layer isolation

The model layer is policy-unaware.
It operates on integer tags and scoped segments.
All policy semantics are resolved in the compilation layer.

## Example

```
Nodes: Grid, Solar, Battery, Switchboard, Load
Policies:
  Grid -> Load: $0.05/kWh
  Solar -> Load: $0.02/kWh
```

| Step             | Result                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Flow enumeration | {(Grid,Load,0.05), (Solar,Load,0.02)}                                           |
| Signatures       | Grid and Solar have different signatures; others have empty signatures          |
| VLANs            | Grid=1, Solar=2, Battery=3 (unpolicied sources share a VLAN)                    |
| Reachability     | Each VLAN covers connections from its sources to every sink                     |
| Connection tags  | Each connection carries only VLANs for paths through it                         |
| Outbound tags    | Grid emits VLAN 1, Solar emits VLAN 2, Battery emits VLAN 3                     |
| Inbound tags     | Load accepts VLAN 1, VLAN 2, and VLAN 3                                         |
| Pricing          | Min-cut for each VLAN is SW→Load: pricing(tag=1,$0.05) and pricing(tag=2,$0.02) |

Result: Solar power is preferred over grid power because it has lower policy cost.
Battery power flows freely at zero policy cost (its VLAN has no pricing elements).

## Testing

Tests live in `custom_components/haeo/core/adapters/tests/test_policy_compilation.py`.

- **Signature computation**: correct signatures from explicit policies only.
- **VLAN assignment**: only policied sources get non-zero VLANs.
- **Reachability**: directed connection tagging for tree topologies.
- **Source enforcement**: `outbound_tags` set on every source node.
- **Default-allow**: unpolicied sources flow to policied destinations at zero cost (no pricing elements on their VLAN).
- **No bypass**: policied sources cannot avoid policy costs by flowing on another VLAN.
- **End-to-end**: full network optimization with policies produces correct costs.
