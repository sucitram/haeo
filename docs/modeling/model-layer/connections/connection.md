# Connection

The `Connection` class models unidirectional power flow between elements.
It composes ordered segments that apply efficiency, limits, and pricing to the flow.
Bidirectional paths are modelled as two separate Connection elements.

## Overview

Connection is the primary model for power flow:

- **Unidirectional**: Each connection flows from `source` to `target`.
- **Composable**: Ordered segment chain defines behavior.
- **Lossless by default**: A passthrough segment is created when no segments are provided.
- **Extensible**: Segment outputs are exposed for adapters and diagnostics.

Segments are provided as an ordered mapping.
The mapping keys become segment names and drive the nested `segments` output.

## Segment types

Connections compose ordered segments. See [segments](../segments/) for details on each type.

## Model formulation

### Decision variables

The Connection creates per-tag LP variables for the input power flow — one per tag per time step:

| Variable              | Domain                  | Description                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| $P_{\\text{in},k}(t)$ | $\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ | Power entering the connection for tag $k$ |

When no tags are specified, a single tag is used so the connection has one flow variable per period.

Segments do **not** create their own variables (except SOC pricing, which creates auxiliary slack variables).
Instead, the Connection passes its power variables through the segment chain.
Each segment receives a `power_in` expression and exposes a `power_out` expression.

### Parameters

| Parameter  | Description                                                                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `source`   | Name of the source element                                                                    |
| `target`   | Name of the target element                                                                    |
| `periods`  | Time period durations (hours)                                                                 |
| `segments` | Ordered mapping of segment names to segment specifications                                    |
| `tags`     | Set of tag IDs for per-source power decomposition (see [Tagged Power](../../tagged-power.md)) |

If `segments` is omitted or empty, a passthrough segment is created automatically.
Segment parameters can be scalars or per-period arrays.
Scalar values are broadcast across all periods.

### Functional segment composition

Segments are **functional transforms** on power expressions. The Connection chains them:

```python
flow = power_in  # The only LP variables (one per time step)
for segment in chain:
    flow = segment.power_out  # Each segment transforms the flow
    # Segments add constraints/costs as side effects
    # Most return input unchanged (identity transforms)
    # Efficiency returns input * factor (an expression, not a new variable)
power_out = flow  # Final output expression
```

This eliminates all inter-segment linking constraints. The variable count equals
the connection flow decisions (T) plus any auxiliary variables (e.g., SOC slack).

### Constraints

Each segment contributes constraints during construction.
Power limits constrain the input expressions.
No linking constraints between segments are needed.

### Power balance interface

Connections provide `power_into_source` and `power_into_target` properties that elements use for power balance:

$$P_{\text{into\_source}}(t) = -P_{\text{in}}(t)$$

$$P_{\text{into\_target}}(t) = P_{\text{out}}(t)$$

Power leaves the source and enters the target.
Efficiency losses are applied inside the segment chain.

### Cost contribution

Connection aggregates cost expressions from all segments.
PricingSegment instances contribute energy costs to the primary objective (index 0).

Connections also contribute a time-preference term to the secondary objective (index 1).
This term weights energy transfer with monotonically increasing per-period weights:

$$
w_{p,t} = p \cdot T + (t + 1)
$$

Where $p$ is the connection's priority (auto-computed from endpoint element types), $T$ is the number of periods, and $t$ is the time step.
The time-preference objective for a connection with priority $p$ is:

$$
\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} w_{p,t} \cdot P_{\text{in}}(t) \cdot \Delta t_t
$$

Connections with different priorities receive non-overlapping weight ranges.
Lower-priority connections are preferred when breaking ties, which the optimizer uses to select among cost-equivalent solutions.
Connections with the same priority share a weight range, so ties between them are broken by time step only.

The secondary objective does not affect the minimum cost—it only selects among cost-equivalent solutions.
The network solves this lexicographically: primary cost is minimized first, then the secondary objective is minimized subject to the primary remaining optimal.

## Outputs

Connection exposes power flow and segment outputs:

- `connection_power` — power flow through this connection
- `segments` — nested map of segment names to constraint shadow outputs

The `segments` output groups segment outputs using the segment names provided in the configuration.
Adapters use this map to surface segment-specific shadow prices.

## Tag decomposition

The connection decomposes its power flow into per-tag LP variables.
This enables [tagged power](../../tagged-power.md) tracking and per-source cost differentiation.

### Per-tag variables

For each tag $k$ in the tag set, a per-tag flow variable is created:

$$
P_{\text{in},k}(t) \geq 0 \quad \forall k \in \text{tags}, \; t \in [0, T-1]
$$

The total flow is the sum of all per-tag flows:

$$
P_{\text{in}}(t) = \sum_{k \in \text{tags}} P_{\text{in},k}(t)
$$

### Per-tag segment transforms

Segments that transform power (e.g., efficiency) are applied proportionally to each tag flow.
For an efficiency segment with factor $\eta$:

$$
P_{\text{out},k}(t) = P_{\text{in},k}(t) \cdot \eta
$$

The sum of per-tag outputs equals the segment's total output.

### Tag prices

Each entry in `tag_prices` adds a price for power flowing on a specific tag:

$$
\text{Cost}_k = \sum_t c_k \cdot P_{\text{in},k}(t) \cdot \Delta t
$$

This enables per-source pricing (e.g., charging a premium for battery-sourced power exported to the grid).

### Per-tag power balance interface

Connections provide per-tag versions of the power balance interface used by elements:

$$P_{\text{into\_source},k}(t) = -P_{\text{in},k}(t)$$

$$P_{\text{into\_target},k}(t) = P_{\text{out},k}(t)$$

## Bidirectional paths

To model bidirectional flow (e.g., grid import/export), create two connections:

- A **forward** connection from source to target
- A **reverse** connection from target to source

Each connection has its own segment chain with independent parameters.
The adapter layer is responsible for combining outputs from both connections
into the appropriate device-level outputs (e.g., grid import power, grid export power).

## When to use

Use Connection for all power-flow paths.
Select the segment chain that matches the physical behavior you need.
