"""Policy compilation: converts policy configs into tagged power flow constraints.

Implements the full compilation pipeline:
1. Flow enumeration — expand policies into (source, dest, price) tuples
2. Signature computation — per-source policy treatment fingerprint
3. VLAN assignment — merge sources with identical signatures (minimum VLANs)
4. Reachability analysis — which connections need which VLANs
5. Connection tagging — per-connection VLAN sets
6. Node outbound tags — enforce source provenance
7. Node inbound tags — default-allow with all active VLANs
8. Pricing injection — per-VLAN sink-side minimum s-t cut placement as
   PolicyPricing model elements with reactive TrackedParam prices

Default-allow model: unpolicied sources produce on tag 0 (the default tag).
Policied sources are forced onto their VLAN by outbound_tags. All tags —
including tag 0 — use the same directed reachability analysis, so a
connection only carries the tags whose sources can actually reach it.
Sink nodes accept all active VLANs plus tag 0, so both policied and
unpolicied power can reach any sink. Costs are applied by PolicyPricing
elements placed on the min-cut edges separating sources from policy-specific
destinations.

See docs/modeling/tagged-power.md for design rationale.
See docs/developer-guide/vlan-optimization.md for optimization proofs.

    Uses directed reachability: forward from sources follows connection

    in the intersection of forward and backward reachable sets are included.

    When ``absorb_at`` is provided (typically the set of sink nodes), the
    forward traversal treats those nodes as absorbing: flow may reach them

    "tag-absorbing" semantics — a VLAN that reaches a battery does not
    propagate onto that battery's outbound connections, so downstream flow
    is tagged with the battery's own provenance rather than passing
    through. Nodes in ``source_nodes`` are exempt from absorption so the
    VLAN's own sources can still expand outward. Backward traversal is
    unaffected, so sinks on the destination side still trace their way
    back to the appropriate sources.

    Edges whose target lies in ``source_nodes`` are excluded from the
    result: a VLAN represents power *originating* at its source, so

    a storage element (battery that is both source and sink for its own
